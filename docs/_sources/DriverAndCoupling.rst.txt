Driver and Coupling 
********************

This section describes the NoahMP land model National Unified Operation Prediction Capability (NUOPC) "cap", which is a light weight software layer that is required when the model is used as a part of the coupled modeling systems compatible with NOUPC such as `UFS Weather Model <https://ufs-weather-model.readthedocs.io/en/ufs-v2.0.0/>`_ 

=================
Supported Drivers
=================

The driver and coupling layer is found under **drivers/** directory. 

Within the **drivers/nuopc/** directory, the following files are found,

NoahMP Land Model Specific ESMF Configuration Options
=====================================================

The NUOPC "cap" uses set of namelist options provided as ESMF Config file format to define domain and configure the NoahMP Land Model. The list of relevant namelist options, which needs to be defined under `LND_attributes::` group can be seen in the following table.

Underlying Model Interfaces
===========================

---------------
Domain Creation
---------------

The current version of the NUOPC "cap" is able to create ESMF grid by reading mosaic grid file. Then, NOUPC "cap" converts created ESMF multi-tile grid to ESMF Mesh to standardize interface and allow running same NUOPC "cap" also reading domain information in ESMF Mesh format (not implemented yet). In this design, only ESMF Mesh is exposed to coupler or mediator via defining fields in import and export states using ESMF Mesh. The land fraction information (`land_frac`) is provided by reading `*oro_data.tile*` files and it is also used to define the land-sea mask (if land_frac is greater than 0 then it is assumed as land, otherwise it is water). The orography data is also defined using `orog_raw` variable in the same files.

--------------
Initialization
--------------

During the `InitializeAdvertise` phase, call is made to `fms_init()` to use `Flexible Modeling System (FMS) <https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fms/>`_ for reading and writing cubed-sphere tiled output. In this case, The MPI communicator is pulled in through the ESMF VM object and used by FMS. This phase also calls `advertise_fields()` to setup import and export states. The FMS initialization will be removed once the multi-tile I/O calls is supported by ESMF.

---
Run
---

During the `ModelAdvance` phase, the `cap` updates the import state and calls NoahMP driver routine (`drv_run`, which is found in `drivers/nuopc/lnd_comp_driver.F90`) to run the model and updates the export state with the information calculated by model. The `drv_run` call mainly read in static information as well as initial conditions when it is first called and interpolate monthly data provided by the static information such as fractional coverage of green vegetation and surface albedo to the date of the simulation. Then calculates solar zenith angle based on the time information extracted from `cap` and calls `noahmpdrv_run` subroutine provided by the NoahMP. This phase also responsible to write NoahMP model output in tiled format by taking advantage of FMS and ESMF routines. 

.. note::
   : the restart capability is only tested with DATM+NOAHMP configuration.

Finalize

This phase is not implemented yet.

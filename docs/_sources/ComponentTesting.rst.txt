*********************************************************************
Building, Running and Testing Land Model Outside of UFS Weather Model 
*********************************************************************

============================
Creating working environment
============================

This section mainly aims to give brief information about creating work environment to test, build, run and develop NoahMP land component outside of the UFS Weather Model. For this purpose, `Docker <https://www.docker.com>`_ container can be used. 

To create Docker container that will be the foundation of development and testing environment:

.. code-block:: console

  docker run -it ubuntu:latest

  apt-get update
  apt-get -y install unzip file gringo
  apt-get -y install build-essential binutils-dev gfortran
  apt-get -y install python3-dev python3-yaml
  apt-get -y install cmake wget ca-certificates vim git

.. note::
   Using container to create test and development environment is optional. The following steps can be used also in other platforms or/and OS in case of lack of depencenies in there.

Then, `spack <https://spack.io>`_ package manager can be used to install dependencies such as ESMF, FMS. In this case, the content of the `spack.yaml` can be structured as following. Also note that the installadtion directory can be changed through the `config` section of the YAML file. 

.. code-block:: yaml 

  spack:
    concretizer:
      unify: true
    specs:
    - fms
    - esmf@8.4.0b15+parallelio~xerces
    - parallelio@2.5.8+pnetcdf~shared
    view: /root/.spack-ci/view
    config:
      source_cache: ~/.spack-ci/source_cache
      misc_cache: ~/.spack-ci/misc_cache
      test_cache: ~/.spack-ci/test_cache
      install_tree:
        root: ~/.spack-ci/opt

To install dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

  mkdir $HOME/test
  cd $HOMEtest

  git clone https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/spack.git
  . spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
  spack -e . concretize -f
  spack -e . install -j3

.. note::
  In this case, the `spack.yaml` is assumed in the test/ directory. In case of having it an other directory, user just need to point the directory after `-e` option (it is set to `.` in this example).

.. note::
  If there is a message like "Fetch anyway?", then just hit "Y".

====================================================
Building Data Atmosphere Forced NoahMP Configuration 
====================================================

Once the working environment is ready, the components of the simple configuration (`datm+lnd`) can be build. In this case, first model components are need to be be build individually.

**NoahMP**

.. code-block:: console

  export PATH=$HOME/.spack-ci/view/bin:$PATH
  export ESMFMKFILE=$HOME/.spack-ci/view/lib/esmf.mk
  export NetCDF_ROOT=`nc-config --prefix`
  export FC=gfortran
  cd $HOME/test
  git clone https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/noahmp
  cd  noahmp
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install -DOPENMP=ON ../
  make
  make install

.. note::
  This will install component specific files (`libnoahmp.a` and `*.cmake`) under installation directory.

**CDEPS**

.. code-block:: console

  export PATH=$HOME/.spack-ci/view/bin:$PATH
  export ESMFMKFILE=$HOME/.spack-ci/view/lib/esmf.mk
  export FC=gfortran
  cd $HOME/test
  git clone -b hotfix/std_build https://github.com/uturuncoglu/CDEPS.git cdeps
  cd cdeps
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../ \
    -DPIO_C_LIBRARY=$HOME/.spack-ci/view/lib \
    -DPIO_C_INCLUDE_DIR=$HOME/.spack-ci/view/include \
    -DPIO_Fortran_LIBRARY=$HOME/.spack-ci/view/lib \
    -DPIO_Fortran_INCLUDE_DIR=$HOME/.spack-ci/view/include \
    -DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS="-ffree-line-length-none -fallow-argument-mismatch -fallow-invalid-boz" \
    -DDISABLE_FoX=ON ../
  make
  make install

.. note::
  Again, this will install component specific files under installation directory.

Then, component libraries can be used to create executable through the use of `ESMX (Earth System Model eXecutable) <https://github.com/esmf-org/esmf/tree/develop/src/addon/ESMX>`_ layer provided by `ESMF <http://earthsystemmodeling.org/docs/nightly/develop/ESMF_refdoc/>`_. 

This requires creating a simple YAML file (`esmxBuild.yaml`) that points component specific files with following content:

.. code-block:: yaml 

  components:
    datm:
      cmake_config: $HOME/test/cdeps/install/lib/cmake/datm-esmx.cmake
      fort_module: cdeps_datm_comp
    noahmp:
      cmake_config: $HOME/test/noahmp/lib/cmake/noahmp-esmx.cmake
      fort_module: lnd_comp_nuopc

.. note::
  File `esmxBuild.yaml` needs to be placed in the $HOME/test/app directory.


The application can be build with following commands:

.. code-block:: console

  export PATH=$HOME/.spack-ci/view/bin:$PATH
  export ESMFMKFILE=$HOME/.spack-ci/view/lib/esmf.mk
  export ESMF_ESMXDIR=$HOME/.spack-ci/view/include/ESMX
  cd $HOME/test
  mkdir app
  cd app
  cmake -H$ESMF_ESMXDIR -Bbuild
  cd build
  make

.. note::
  This will create `esmx` executable under build/ directory.

===================================================
Running Data Atmosphere Forced NoahMP Configuration
===================================================

To run `esmx` executable, the run directory, which includes input files for both CDEPS and NoahMP components, is required. The more information about running UFS Weather Model datm+lnd configuration can be found in :ref:`BuildingAndRunning`.

===========================
Automated Component Testing
===========================

The NoahMP model uses GitHub Actions (GHA), a GitHub-hosted continuous integration service, to perform CI/CD testing. The GHA is triggered in following cases,

#. When a developer makes a pull request (PR) to the NoahMP repository

#. When a developer makes a direct push to default branch (i.e. develop)

#. Twice a week on Monday and Friday (This is required to prevent auto-removing cache entries after 7-days)

#. Repository admin could also trigger GHA manually

The GHA-related ``yaml`` script is located in the ``.github/workflows/`` directory. ``datm_noahmp.yaml`` is the main workflow file that aim to run `datm+lnd` configuration. 

* `.github/workflows/tests/` directory includes YAML files that will be used to create required configuration files for CDEPS and NoahMP and retrive required input files.
* `.github/workflows/data/` directory includes additional the input files that are not found on the web to retrive.
* `.github/workflows/scripts/` directory includes Python scripts that reads the information from YAML files to create configuration files and retrieve required input files.
* `.github/workflows/spack/` directory includes `spack.yaml` file that is used to insatll dependencies through the use of `spack <https://spack.io>`_ package manager.
